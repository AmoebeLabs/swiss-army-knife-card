# ![](docs/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) NOTE!
This Swiss Army Knife custom card is being prepared for a public release. Don't use this card yet!

Due to configuration changes and some breaking issues, this card is currently broken ðŸ˜¢

# ![](docs/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) The Swiss Army Knife Custom Card for Home Assistant
The custom Swiss Army Knife card for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] allows you to create your own visualization using [17 basic, advanced and Home Assistant specific SVG-based tools][sak-tools] and CSS [styling][sak-css-styles] and [animation][sak-css-animations] options this card provides.

It is a card with lots of possibilities, fully YAML based, and requires the [user to design a card][sak-how-to-design-your-card]!
What you can make is only limited by the 17 provided tools and your own imagination.

Remember that this custom card is in public **BETA** **BETA** **BETA** as of June/July 2022!

Check https://swiss-army-knife.docs.amoebelabs.com/ for the documentation!

And check https://ha-m3-themes.docs.amoebelabs.com/ for Material 3 themes documentation. It has 22 light and dark [example themes](https://ha-m3-themes.docs.amoebelabs.com/examples/introduction/) used by example card [11][example-11] and [12][example-12]!

## ![](docs/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) Hybrid or Full manual Installation
This custom card should be in the default theme repository of HACS, if you have selected BETA releases.

For installation check the [installation documentation][sak-installation]. As this custom card requires **extra steps on top of HACS** for its installation. The card itself can be installed with HACS, but:
- The card requires extra configuration files to function
- If you want to use the examples and example dashboard, you must download the themes, views and templates too!

Note: It may take a few weeks (as of June 2022) that this card is included into the HACS repository!

## ![](docs/images/swiss-army-knife24.png) An overview of all the [12 examples](https://swiss-army-knife.docs.amoebelabs.com/examples/introduction/) from my own installation:
All these examples are available on Github and described in the [installation manual][sak-installation]. Each example has its own page which describes how to adapt / use them in your own installation.
