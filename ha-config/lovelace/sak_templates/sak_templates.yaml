#
# CSS Definitions
#
# Next file contains the SAK CSS definitions for all the tools. Do NOT change this file!
# If you want to change the CSS definitions, please do that in the user_css_definitions.yaml file.
#
# The ability to overwrite/redefine existing classes and make your own classes
# opens up a lot of possibilities & re-use. 
# If you re-use an existing design/layout but want other colors that are defined
# using classes, you simply redefine the classes to your own needs and you can
# have your own look&feel.
#
# NOTE:
# CSS classes are still experimental and introduced recently. So most of the
# examples use direct (inline) styling, and not classes.
#
# CSS definitions are covering:
# - CSS class styling for tools
# - CSS animations
# - CSS Filters
